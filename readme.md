**Resume Layout**
![A visual layout of a Resume with Name centered in the middle. Underneath, Phone is left-aligned, address (if applicable) is center-aligned, and email is right aligned. A line acts as a separator. Job Title is center-aligned underneath that line. Under job title, Relevant expertise words (typically 27-30) are listed. Following that, a brief 3-5 sentence paragraph that acts as an elevator pitch for you and your credentials. Finally, there is the standard career profile of the resume.](https://github.com/alexandermervar/networking/blob/master/Resume%20Layout.png)
